# Vercel Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Dependencies optimized (reduced from 22 to 9 packages)
✅ Removed unused packages (aiokafka, emails, gunicorn, etc.)
✅ Fixed FastAPI/Starlette version conflicts
✅ Added .vercelignore to exclude Poetry files
✅ Bundle size should now be under 250MB

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: optimize dependencies for Vercel deployment - remove unused packages and fix version conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project
- Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
- The build should now succeed

### 3. If Still Getting Starlette Errors
The error might be due to Vercel's build cache. Try:
- In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings → Functions
- Clear the build cache
- Redeploy again
